# Assignment 3 Q1

This little application simply interfaces with a postgres database,
and prompts the user to:
- add an entry to the table
- update an entry from the table
- delete an entry from the table
- show the entire table

### Setup:
- You must have psycopg2 and pandas installed (pip install into a venv)
- run main.py
- follow the instructions in the terminal (use a proper terminal to be able to enter the password)
